# MERN_Stack_WhatsApp_Clone
MERN Stack WhatsApp Clone Web App.

I developed this web app as a practice project while learning MERN Stack.
It has a ReactJs frontend, ExpressJs backend, MongoDb Atlas database, with NodeJs as the environment on which it executes. For real-time chatting functionality, I used the Socket.io package.
Furthermore, for attractive frontend components, I made use of the MaterialUi packages and their components, as well as general css.
